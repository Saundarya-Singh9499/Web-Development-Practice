    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ut voluptatibus numquam sunt, aliquid rem ex sequi

    <p>A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about
        paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one
        central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.</p>


    <p>Paragraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea directs the paragraphâ€™s
        development. Often, the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a topic sentence. In some
        cases, you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph controlling idea.</p>

    <p id="p">A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a
        sentence
        called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an
        essays thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and it
        advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers generally look
        to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph.</p>
